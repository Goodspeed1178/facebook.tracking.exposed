There are three degree you can be involved with the project, you'll be mentioned on the [about](/about) page when you reach the third.


## First step: know a bit of us

{{<colorblock text="First step" >}}

Read our most recent publications marked as [articles](/analysis-and-publication), they are the shortest. If you want to read also 'longform' or 'videos', you welcome!

{{<box color="secondary" text="Install the browser extension." >}}

You should install if for yourself and for a friend.
This is not a joke =) engage with a friend you'll test your ability of talking about the project, and you'll understand what is not correctly explained by us. Plus, you'll test how much you want to really be dedicated on this. At the end: you are the one who wants to join.

If you don't have Facebook (**congraturation!**) you should create a dummy profile. You might find helpful these notes on how to [how to create a research persona](/research-persona).

## Second step: get into the process

Join our mattermost channel, say helo.

Based on your experience made at the first step if you found something unclear, you need to open a github account (is the only way to interact with the software project), 

* **You found a content problem?** such as expression, English grammar, broken links, or missing pieces? You should [create a new issue](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/facebook.tracking.exposed/issues), describe the change you expect and why it matters. 
* If you find any limit **is the brwoser extension**, [create an issue on the appropriate repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/web-extension/issues), that package is mostly javascript code.
* If analysis, API or metadata format are broken to you, reach out [in simple English](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/facebook/issues).

Please! Read carefully the existing open tickets, what is listed there would be addressed with a certain time, and then reported in our [monthly report](https://tracking.exposed/monthly). In the mattermost channel we can have a discussion about your issue, before you open it on github.

## Third step: active role

* TODO

### The issue with volunteers 

They require time. knowledge transfert, weekly support, constant updates. We are trying to build a self-sustaining system, and there is not a cookbook because every community is different.
