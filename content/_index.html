            <p>Since its rise in 2004, Facebook has grown into the largest social
            networking service online. Gathering almost 2 billions of active users a month,
            the resulting data generated by the community makes it extremely difficult for
            the users to acquire and process relevant information in a meaningful way. To
            overcome the problem of information overload, Facebook has started to deploy
            personalization algorithms.</p>

            <p>Personalization algorithms are tools to customize information, determining
            its importance for a specific user. On the basis of users’ identity and
            interactions, specific bits of information are preferred while other are hidden
            from her view. By deploying this filtering mechanism, Facebook ensure that each
            user can have a meaningful experience of the service, instead of dealing with an
            unorganized information flow.</p>

            <p>Personalization algorithms have to be judged positively in its potential to
            engage with basic human need in the information era: reduce information
            overload, increase its scope and usability, and support users autonomy of making
            informed choices. However, while algorithms facilitate the managing of
            information, new researches have shown evidences that this benefit is largely
            balanced by the social and individual negative effect of filtering.</p>

    <h2>The Problem with algorithmic personalization</h2>

    <p>The design of personalization algorithms is not just a technical matter,
    but a political one. We do not claim that personalization algorithms are bad; we
    claim that bad personalization algorithms are bad.</p>

    <p>Facebook filtering occurs in silence, with the filtering occurring before
    the user interact with the information. The user has no active control on what
    she’s exposed to; this is settled by the algorithm according to her digital
    identity. However, filtering results in the creation of a bubble, a bundle of
    only that information that match her preferences.</p>

    <p>This phenomenon, known as “the filter bubble” or “echo chamber” or again
    “information cocoons”, actually decrease users autonomy of making informed
    choices. By decreasing the quality and variety of information the user consume
    in its personal bubble, her ability to critically evaluate and deal with
    contrary opinions, especially in the context of public debates, is potentially
    damaged.</p>

    <p>Facebook filtering acts on the basis of an identity that is considered fixed
    through different contexts: many interactions, one filter. But the interactions
    that shape users’ identity are much more contextual than what is actually taken
    to be.</p>

    <p>As individuals, we know that information shared in some context is often
    inappropriate to share in another. That’s why we have different disclosure
    expectation of the same bit of information in respect to different situations or
    people. Our ability to keep track of the flow of information we send and receive
    through different context is what makes privacy valuable for our individual
    autonomy.</p>

    <p>However, given Facebook treatment of identity, personalization algorithms
    tend to filter out information that is important in one context just because it
    is not relevant according to the general profile, potentially damaging our
    ability to exercise our privacy preferences and recognize its personal and
    social value.</p>

    <p>Facebook personalization algorithms are not yet open to public scrutiny. But
    the public has the right to demand a transparent disclosure of the rules by
    which those algorithms silently shape the way we manage information both as
    individuals and as societies. This is not only valuable for individuals and
    societies, but also for Facebook itself. In the long run, the effect of those
    algorithms can potentially disrupt the value underneath Facebook business
    partnerships with firms. In fact, by tightening users’ preferences,
    personalization algorithms might actually create a customer type hostile to the
    advertising and testing of new products that do not fit its identity
    expectation.</p>
