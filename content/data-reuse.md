The evidence collected by the project supporters might be suitable for reuse.

#### We can't allow ourselves to:

1) allow or enable [social media intelligence](https://privacyinternational.org/explainer/55/social-media-intelligence).
2) provide API which might help additional user profiling if a malicious third party want to use the fbtrex data

#### The data should fit these requirements:

1) be sure the content was meant to be public by the original author
2) _unlinked_ from the user supporting the project with their unique observations of the social media
3) Contains at least one topic of public interest
4) Be searchable only by topics of public interest

To do point 2 and 3, we assume all the voices in Wikipedia are topic in the public interest. (this contributes to distributing responsibilities instead of centralizing it, and to resort on a collective intelligence).
Every observed public post, from every browser with installed the extension, get their text (if any, and if it is longer than 140 chars) to be semantically analyzed. It allows anyone to subscribe to RSS feed by following the semantic topics available. It is a preliminary example of a basic algorithm.

#### Further readings

1) the public API format documentation, originally on this [github issue](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/facebook/issues/128), and ported to our [API documentation](/api-documentation/) page.
2) the [project status 2018](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/presentation/blob/master/fbTREX%20-%20project%20status%20and%20analysis%20-%20December%202018.pdf), it explain our challenge and process.
