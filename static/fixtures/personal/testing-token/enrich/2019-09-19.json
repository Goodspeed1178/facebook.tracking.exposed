That was exactly what I used to say: In 1991 people were actually tricked – the dissolution of the USSR was presented by state media as reconsideration or rebranding of the same Union.  The term independence meant nothing in 1991 because the Soviet republics were always represented for people as independent states in a sort of Union.  That’s why in spring 1991 they voted for the USSR in the first referendum, and later that year – for independency.
